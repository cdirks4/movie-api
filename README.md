I think I will end up with at least one or two more just unsure at the moment. // ended up with 5 child zcomponents and an app component

## User Stories

- as a user Id like to find new popular Movies // created a tab on side bar for this
- as a user Id like to find movies in the same genre // created genre drop down
- as a user Id like a well organized site where I wont have difficulties navigating it // I feel as though the site is easy to navigate and user friendly

### MVP Goals

- Able to display movies and titles // multiple pages displaying movies
- Able to pull details on a specific movie cast description etc //Was able to get details on the movie but not cast.

### Stretch Goals

Bronze:

- search bar // created a search bar to search through movies
- clickable category links in side bar // created a side bar with routes

  Silver:

- bundling movies by category // created a genre drop down
- improving style to be more dynamic maybe an animation when a cover shows up or slide show of movies on front page // did not get as far as making a slide show but the page is reactive how I was hoping
- giving producers a page with movies they have produced // did not get to this

  Gold:

- try pulling trailers from youtube api // I did not end up needing to use the youtube api as they were already integrated into the TMDB api
